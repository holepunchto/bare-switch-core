// The Bare worklet: the "backend" of the app, running on its own thread inside
// the host app's process (macOS, iOS, ...). It owns a Hyperswarm node - a real
// peer-to-peer connection to every other copy of this app on the same topic -
// and exposes a typed hrpc interface to the native Swift UI over the IPC channel.
//
// There is no server anywhere. Two instances of the app find each other through
// the distributed hash table and talk directly, end-to-end encrypted.
//
// The interesting state logic (local vs. remote changes, no-echo/no-loop) lives
// in ./lib/switch.js and is unit-tested; this file is just the wiring.
